## 2026-01-27 - [GitHub Profile Accessibility & UX]
**Learning:** Social media icons in GitHub profile READMEs often use usernames as alt text, which is unhelpful for screen readers. Using the platform name (e.g., "Twitter") is much more accessible. Additionally, long profiles benefit significantly from a "Back to Top" navigation element.
**Action:** Always check social icon alt text and consider adding a "Back to Top" link for long READMEs.

**Action:** Simplify nested table structures in READMEs to improve maintainability and rendering consistency.
